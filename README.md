# TLDR

* Install MinToolkit (aka DockerSlim): https://github.com/mintoolkit/mint#installation
* Shrink your container image: `mint slim your-container-image`

Note: you may need additional CLI flags. See the examples in this repo and the README in the app repo: https://github.com/mintoolkit/mint

# Overview

`mintoolkit` (aka `docker-slim` and `slimtoolkit`) has been used with Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, Rust, Elixir and PHP (some app types) running on Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS and Alpine Linux.

Active areas of interest:
* Complex Python, Ruby and PHP examples with the popular application servers and Nginx or Apache.
* Python, Node.js, Ruby and PHP applications packaged in CentOS-based images.
* Examples with fat container images with multiple components/applications/services.
* Examples with the most popular process supervisors / init tools.

# How to use examples

While **Mint** is capable of more, at the moment, the majority of the examples illustrate
the image minification procedure using `mint build` (aka `mint slim`) command in its various modes. 

A typical example has a _README_ file describing its purpose and basic usage.
Normally, there is also a _Makefile_ with the `default` target. So, running
`make` or `make default` from inside of the example folder would execute the example
for you _end-to-end_ outputting all the used commands on the way.

Most frequently used `make` targets:

```sh
# All example types
make                             # run example (semi-automatic)
make test-e2e                    # run the acceptance test suite
make clean                       # remove all artifacts created by this example


# 'CLI application' example type
make fat-build                   # build the "fat" version of the image
make fat-run-interactive         # run the CLI app using the "fat" image

make slim-build                  # turn the "fat" image into a "slim" one
make slim-run-interactive        # run the CLI app using the "slim" image

make slim-build-from-dockerfile  # build the "slim" version of the image using the "fat" Dockerfile


# 'Web Service' example type
make fat-build                   # build the "fat" version of the image
make fat-run                     # run the web service using the "fat" image
make fat-run-seccomp             # run the "fat" image using generated seccomp profile
make fat-validate                # send a request to the running web service
make fat-stop                    # stop the running web service

make slim-build                  # turn the "fat" image into a "slim" one
make slim-run                    # run the web service using the "slim" image
make slim-run-seccomp            # run the "slim" image using generated seccomp profile
make slim-validate               # send a request to the running web service
make slim-stop                   # stop the running web service

make slim-build-from-dockerfile  # build the "slim" version of the image using the "fat" Dockerfile

make debug-sidecar               # run a debug sidecar container with an interactive shell


# 'Docker Compose' example type
make fat-build                   # build the "fat" version of the image
make fat-run                     # run the compose file using the "fat" image
make fat-validate                # send a request to the running web service
make fat-stop                    # stop the running web service

make slim-build-compose          # turn the "fat" image into a "slim" one using docker-compose file
make slim-run                    # run the compose file using the "slim" image
make slim-validate               # send a request to the running web service
make slim-stop                   # stop the running web service
```
